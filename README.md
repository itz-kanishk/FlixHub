# FlixHub: The Entertainment Website


To run this app, you would first need to register on the movie database's api website where you will get a key for fetching data through react.

link for getting the api key: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started

this key should be pasted in a seperate. env file with the format of REACT_API_APP_KEY= KEY VAL

after doing this go to terminal and type in npm run start to run the app.

Thanks.
